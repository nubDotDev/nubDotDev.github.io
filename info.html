    <h2>Algorithms</h2>
    <p>To better understand the following pseudo-code:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every cell starts with none of its walls broken.</li>
      <li>There exists a set containing every cell in the maze.</li>
      <li>To connect two neighboring cells is to break the wall that separates them.</li>
      <li>For a cell to be visited is for it to have at least one broken wall or for it to be the starting cell.</li>
    </ul>

        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Initialize current to a random cell
While not every cell is visited
  Initialize next to a random neighbor of current
  If next is not visited
    Connect current and next
  Set current to next
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li id="eller">
        <h3>Eller</h3>
        <p>This algorithm is one of the fastest on the site, and it allows for mazes of infinite length to be generated
          because it never looks at more than two rows at a time.</p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Initialize sets to an empty disjoint set
For each row
  Delete from sets the data for every cell that is neither a root nor in the row
  For each cell in the row that is not in sets
    Add a set containing the cell to sets
  Initialize current to the leftmost cell in the row
  While current != the rightmost cell in the row
    Initialize next to the cell directly to the right of current
    If find current in sets != find next in sets
      Randomly or if the row = the bottom row
        Connect current and next
        Union current and next in sets
    Set current to next
  If the row != the bottom row
    For each set in sets
      Randomly at least once
        Connect a cell from the set in the row and the cell directly below it

      </li>

      <li id="growingTree">
        <h3>Growing Tree</h3>
        <p>This algorithm is particularly intersting because it allows for a result identical to the simplified Prim's
          algorithm, the recursive backtracking algorithm or anywhere in between the two depending on how it is
          configured. Looking at the simplicity of the algorithms pseudo-code, it's flexibility seems almost inevitable.
          The "index anchor" field represents which cell the algorithm is biased to pick (0 being the oldest in the tree
          and 1 being the newest in the tree). The "anchor bias" field represents how biased the algorithm is to the
          chosen anchor (0 being entirely random and 1 being guaranteed). If the anchor bias is 0, the result is
          identical to the simplified Prim's algorithm because a random cell will always be chosen. If both the growing
          tree index and the anchor bias are 1, the result is identical to the recursive backtracking algorithm because
          the newest cell will always be chosen, and if the newest cell has no unvisited neighbors, the algorithm
          backtracks to the previous cell.</p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Initialize maze to a set containing a random cell
While maze is not empty
  Initialize current to a random element of maze
  If current has an unvisited neighbor
    Connect current and a random unvisited neighbor of current
  Else
    Remove current from maze

        <h3>Hunt and Kill</h3>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Initialize current to a random cell
While not every cell is visited
  While current has an unvisited neighbor
    Initialize next to a random unvisited neighbor of current
    Connect current and next
    Set current to next
  For each cell
    If the cell is unvisited and the cell has a visited neighbor

      <li id="kruskal">
        <h3>Kruskal</h3>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Initialize sets to an empty disjoint set
Initialize walls to a set containing every cell wall
While sets has more than one set
  Connect the two cells on either side of a randomly popped element of walls
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li id="nAryTree">
        <h3>N-Ary Tree</h3>
        <p>This algorithm was originally called the binary tree algorithm, but since here it is compatible with
          non-square cell shapes with more than two sides facing a positive direction (i.e., each node of the tree can
          have more than two children), it was renamed to be more accurate. The result has a very obvious flow in the
          positive X, Y, and Z direction. There is always a path running along all three axes for the entirety of the
          maze at the maximum X, Y, and Z coordinates. This algorithm is incompatible with a delta grid because every
          other cell has no side facing the positive Z direction which would allow for isolated sections of the maze.
        </p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
For each cell
  Initialize next to a random neighbor of the cell whose coordinates are all >= those of the cell
  If next exists
    Connect the cell and next
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li id="prim">
        <h3>Prim</h3>
        <p>The Prim's algorithm implemented on this site is the classical Prim's algorithm, which means that every wall
          has a static weight. In the modified version, every cell has a static weight and a random wall is chosen of
          the cell with the highest weight every iteration. In the simplified version, there are no static weights, so a
          random wall is picked every iteration. To see what the simplified version looks like, check the growing
          tree algorithm.</p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Assign every cell wall a random weight
Initialize frontier to a set containing the walls of a random cell
While not every cell is visited
  Initialize cell1 and cell2 to the cells separated by the popped element of frontier with the highest weight
  If cell1 xor cell2 is unvisited
    Connect cell1 and cell2
    Add the walls of cell1 and cell2 to frontier
        </pre>

      <li id="recursiveBacktracking">
        <h3>Recursive Backtracking</h3>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Initialize backtrack to an empty stack
Initialize current to a random cell
While not every cell is visited
  If current has an unvisited neighbor
    Initialize next to a random unvisited neighbor of current
    Connect current and next
    Set current to next
  Else
    Pop backtrack and set current to the result
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li id="recursiveDivision">
        <h3>Recursive Division</h3>
        <p>This algorithm is unique because it is the only algorithm that uses wall building instead of wall breaking.
          The "index anchor" field represents where in each section the algorithm is biased to make a division (0 being
          the top or left and 1 being the bottom or right). The "anchor bias" field represents how biased the algorithm
          is to the chosen anchor (0 being entirely random and 1 being guaranteed).</p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Break every cell wall
Define divide as a function of a section of the maze
  Initialize division to a random X or Z coordinate inside the section
  Build every wall inside the section with the coordinate division
  Break a random wall inside the section with the coordinate division
  For each of the two subsections made by the division
    Call divide on the subsection
Call divide on the maze
