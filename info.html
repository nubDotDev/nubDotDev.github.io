    <h2>Algorithms</h2>
    <p>For all of the following pseudo-code, it is assumed that there is a set containing every cell in the maze
      starting with none of its walls broken. For a cell to be visited is for it to have at least one of its walls
      broken or for it to be the starting cell. This can most easily be managed with a set. To connect two adjacent
      cells is to break the wall that separates them.</p>

        <p>This algorithm is one of the fastest on the site, and it allows for mazes of infinite length to be generated
          because it never looks at more than two rows at a time.</p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <ol>
          <li>For each cell in the first row, initialize a set containing the cell.</li>
          <li>Randomly connect horizontally adjacent cells in the current row if they are in different sets and merge
            their sets.</li>
          <li>For each set, randomly connect at least one cell in the current row to the cell directly below it.</li>
          <li>For each cell in the next row, if it is not in a set, initialize a set containing the cell.</li>
          <li>For each row except the last, repeat 2-4.</li>

        <h3>Growing Tree</h3>
        <p>This algorithm is particularly intersting because it allows for a result identical to the simplified Prim's
          algorithm, the recursive backtracking algorithm or anywhere in between the two depending on how it is
          configured. Looking at the simplicity of the algorithms pseudo-code, it's flexibility seems almost inevitable.
          The "growing tree index" field represents which cell the algorithm is biased to pick (0 being the oldest in
          the tree and 1 being the newest in the tree). The "index bias" field represents how biased the algorithm is to
          the chosen index (0 being entirely random and 1 being guaranteed). If the index bias is 0, the result is
          identical to the simplified Prim's algorithm because a random cell will always be chosen. If both the growing
          tree index and the index bias are 1, the result is identical to the recursive backtracking algorithm because
          the newest cell will always be chosen, and if the newest cell has no unvisited neighbors, the algorithm
          backtracks to the previous cell.</p>

      <li id="nAryTree">
        <h3>N-Ary Tree</h3>
        <p>This algorithm was originally called the binary tree algorithm, but since here it is compatible with
          non-square cell shapes with more than two sides facing a positive direction (i.e., each node of the tree can
          have more than two children), it was renamed to be more accurate. The result has a very obvious flow in the
          positive X, Y, and Z direction. There is always a path running along all three axes for the entirety of the
          maze at the maximum X, Y, and Z coordinates. This algorithm is incompatible with a delta grid because every
          other cell has no side facing the positive Z direction which would allow for isolated sections of the maze.
