Initialize current to a random cell

        <p>This algorithm is one of the fastest on the site, and it allows for mazes of infinite length to be generated
          because it never looks at more than two rows at a time.</p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Initialize sets to an empty disjoint set
For each row
  Delete from sets the data for every cell that is neither a root nor in the row
  For each cell in the row that is not in sets
    Add a set containing the cell to sets
  Initialize current to the leftmost cell in the row
  While current != the rightmost cell in the row

        <h3>Growing Tree</h3>
        <p>This algorithm is particularly intersting because it allows for a result identical to the simplified Prim's
          algorithm, the recursive backtracking algorithm or anywhere in between the two depending on how it is
          configured. Looking at the simplicity of the algorithms pseudo-code, it's flexibility seems almost inevitable.
          The "index anchor" field represents which cell the algorithm is biased to pick (0 being the oldest in the tree
          and 1 being the newest in the tree). The "anchor bias" field represents how biased the algorithm is to the
          chosen anchor (0 being entirely random and 1 being guaranteed). If the anchor bias is 0, the result is
          identical to the simplified Prim's algorithm because a random cell will always be chosen. If both the growing
          tree index and the anchor bias are 1, the result is identical to the recursive backtracking algorithm because
          the newest cell will always be chosen, and if the newest cell has no unvisited neighbors, the algorithm
          backtracks to the previous cell.</p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>

        <h3>Kruskal</h3>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Initialize sets to an empty disjoint set
Initialize walls to a set containing every cell wall
While sets has more than one set
  Connect the two cells on either side of a randomly popped element of walls
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li id="nAryTree">
        <h3>N-Ary Tree</h3>
        <p>This algorithm was originally called the binary tree algorithm, but since here it is compatible with
          non-square cell shapes with more than two sides facing a positive direction (i.e., each node of the tree can
          have more than two children), it was renamed to be more accurate. The result has a very obvious flow in the
          positive X, Y, and Z direction. There is always a path running along all three axes for the entirety of the
          maze at the maximum X, Y, and Z coordinates. This algorithm is incompatible with a delta grid because every
          other cell has no side facing the positive Z direction which would allow for isolated sections of the maze.
        </p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
For each cell
  Initialize next to a random neighbor of the cell whose coordinates are all >= those of the cell
  If next exists
    Connect the cell and next

      <li id="prim">
        <h3>Prim</h3>
        <p>The Prim's algorithm implemented on this site is the classical Prim's algorithm, which means that every wall
          has a static weight. In the modified version, every cell has a static weight and a random wall is chosen of
          the cell with the highest weight every iteration. In the simplified version, there are no static weights, so a
          random wall is picked every iteration. To see what the simplified version looks like, check the growing
          tree algorithm.</p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Assign every cell wall a random weight
Initialize frontier to a set containing the walls of a random cell
While not every cell is visited
  Initialize cell1 and cell2 to the cells separated by the popped element of frontier with the highest weight

Initialize current to a random cell
While not every cell is visited
  If current has an unvisited neighbor
    Initialize next to a random unvisited neighbor of current
    Connect current and next
    Set current to next
  Else
    Pop backtrack and set current to the result

      </li>

      <li id="recursiveDivision">
        <h3>Recursive Division</h3>
        <p>This algorithm is unique because it is the only algorithm that uses wall building instead of wall breaking.
          The "index anchor" field represents where in each section the algorithm is biased to make a division (0 being
          the top or left and 1 being the bottom or right). The "anchor bias" field represents how biased the algorithm
          is to the chosen anchor (0 being entirely random and 1 being guaranteed).</p>
        <b>Pseudo-Code:</b>
        <pre>
Break every cell wall
Define divide as a function of a section of the maze
  Initialize division to a random X or Z coordinate inside the section
  Build every wall inside the section with the coordinate division
  Break a random wall inside the section with the coordinate division
  For each of the two subsections made by the division
    Call divide on the subsection

  <div id="customGrids">
    <h2>Custom Grids</h2>
    <p>If enabled, equations and inequalities can be used to create custom grid shapes. This is accomplished using the
      <a href="https://mathjs.org/docs/expressions/parsing.html">math.js evaluate function</a>. For every coordinate in
      the specified dimensions, the equation or inequality will be used to check whether or not to place a cell there.
      The top left cell on the first floor has coordinates of (0, 0, 0) and coordinates increase going to the right,
      down, and to the following floors. To represent the width, length, and height of the grid, the variables <i>w</i>,
      <i>l</i>, and <i>h</i> are used respectively. For the coordinates of the cell being checked, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>,
      and <i>z</i> are used. In order for a custom grid to be legal, it must be possible to connect every cell.</p>
    <p>Example: "x/w <= z/l" would result in a right triangle with legs spanning the left and bottom sides of the grid
        and its hypotenuse being the diagonal starting from the top left.</p>
