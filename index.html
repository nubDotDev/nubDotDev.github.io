              <strong>Abstract:</strong>
              Off-lattice agent-based models (or cell-based models) of
              multicellular systems are increasingly used to create in-silico
              models of in-vitro and in-vivo experimental setups of cells and
              tissues, such as cancer spheroids, neural crest cell migration,
              and liver lobules. These applications, which simulate thousands to
              millions of cells, require robust and efficient numerical methods.
              At their core, these models necessitate the solution of a large
              friction-dominated equation of motion, resulting in a sparse,
              symmetric, and positive definite matrix equation. The conjugate
              gradient method is employed to solve this problem, but this
              requires a good preconditioner for optimal performance. In this
              study, we develop a graph-based preconditioning strategy that can
              be easily implemented in such agent-based models. Our approach
              centers on extending support graph preconditioners to
              block-structured matrices. We prove asymptotic bounds on the
              condition number of these preconditioned friction matrices. We
              then benchmark the conjugate gradient method with our support
              graph preconditioners and compare its performance to other common
              preconditioning strategies.

              One of my passions is math and computer science exposition, and I
              have found that making videos is an excellent outlet. I make
              videos on whatever topics in math and computer science I believe I
              can meaningfully explain in around 10&ndash;20 minutes. My primary

              In computer graphics, it is useful to be able to sample random
              points in space such that no two are within a fixed minimum
              distance of each other. This is called Poisson disk sampling.
              There are a number of ways to generate these samples, and I
              implemented a number of them in my Rust crate
              <a href="https://crates.io/crates/faster_poisson"
                >faster_poisson</a
              >. If you vary the minimum distance between points, you can
              achieve a stippling effect on images like this (they look much
              better zoomed in).

              The third image is the result of generating samples for the red,
              green, and blue color channels separately and then combining them.
              So the final image uses only

              One of the methods for generating Poisson disk samples runs very
              efficiently on the GPU, which enabled me to stipple webcam footage
              in realtime on the website linked above. It relies heavily on
              WebGPU and compute shaders, so it only works on certain browsers
              with graphics acceleration enabled (tested in Chrome).

              before there has to be a set. If we treat each of the 81 cards as
              points in \(\mathbb{F}_3^4\), then the question becomes how many
              points can be taken before 3 of them have to be colinear (i.e., in

              know the exact solution in dimensions greater than 6. This

              is a randomized greedy approach, and the other generates all cap

              This website is a big reason for my love of algorithms today. I
              made it at the end of high school, and it was my first real
              exposure to graph theory. I was blown away by how many ways there
              are to generate a maze. I strongly recommend this as a project for
              anyone who wants a fun and intuitive introduction to graph
              algorithms.

              When I rode the NJ Transit, I was fascinated by a 105-segment
              display used on the trains. I took some pictures and spent the
              next few days turning it into a font. Here's a sample:

              Every semester I would find myself doing the same grade
              calculations in Desmos to figure out what I needed on an exam. So
              I made a website for it.
